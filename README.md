# ITAD-Rzeszow-websockets

Application for websocket presentation on ITAD'16 in Rzesz√≥w / Poland

Demo and competition/integeration game for the audience.

Audience could connect to the application with their smartphones and
play a visual game. Game data has been sent with websockets from each smartphone to 
my laptop so each one could see the game on their smartphone and
on the bigscreen as well.

The concept for the appliaction was to show how fast websockets are to handle hunderds of connections
streaming data in the real time.
